## Introduction

Welcome to the README file for the "Electricity Provision Optimization for Assam Villages" project. This document provides an overview of the project's goals, the challenges it addresses, the solutions proposed, and the outcomes achieved.

## Problem Statement

The challenge of extending electricity to all villages in Assam is complex and requires meticulous planning. Collaborating with the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati (IITG), the Assam Electricity Board has undertaken the responsibility of electrifying all villages in the region. The primary objective of this project is to find a cost-effective and efficient method to connect all villages to the electricity grid.

## Solution Approach

The project aimed to determine the most optimal approach for providing electricity to all villages in Assam. Through an extensive optimization process, the study concluded that establishing a chain of connections with already electrified villages is the most cost-effective method. Additionally, the project identifies optimal power plant locations and the minimum number of power plants required for complete electrification.

## Optimization Results

The optimization efforts have yielded the following results:

- **Connection Chain Strategy**: Connecting villages through a chain of connections with already electrified villages emerged as the most cost-effective approach for electrification.

- **Optimal Power Plant Locations**: The project has identified strategic locations for placing power plants, enhancing the efficiency of electricity distribution.

- **Minimum Power Plants**: By employing optimization techniques, the study determined the minimum number of power plants needed for comprehensive electrification.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the power grid optimization model developed using the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) has effectively tackled the challenge of electrifying all Assam villages in a cost-effective manner. The model's outcomes offer valuable insights into the most optimal approach for village electrification. The Assam Electricity Board can leverage these insights to make informed decisions and allocate resources efficiently, ensuring electricity access for all villages in the state. Overall, this project highlights the potential of mathematical modeling and optimization techniques to solve complex energy sector problems. The achieved results underscore the efficacy of the Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model in GAMS for optimization problem-solving and its applicability to similar challenges in the future.

## Usage

To leverage the findings and insights of this project:

1. **Review**: Thoroughly study the documentation to understand the optimization approach and results.

2. **Adaptation**: Consider adapting the model and recommendations to suit other regions or electrification initiatives.

3. **Implementation**: Collaborate with relevant stakeholders to implement the proposed strategies effectively.
